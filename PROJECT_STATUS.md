```python
from publer import PublerClient

# Initialize (loads from .env)
with PublerClient() as client:
    # Get workspaces
    workspaces = client.workspaces.list()
    client.set_workspace(workspaces[0].id)
    
    # Create a post
    result = client.posts.create(
        text="Hello from Publer API!",
        accounts=[client.accounts.list()[0].id],
        scheduled_at="2025-10-15T10:00:00+00:00"
    )
    
    # Auto-poll until complete
    status = client.job_status(result["job_id"], poll=True)
```
